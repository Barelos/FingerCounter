Abstract:
  A program that when presented with an image of a hand holding fingers up
  tells how many fingers are held up 2 ways.
  Neural net and tree classifier.

Goals:
  1) Read images, calculate derivative and perform DFT.
  2) Make tree classifier.
  3) Train neural net.

TODO: read image
  1) read from camera.
  2) threshold into 2 colors.
  3) calculate derivative (simple no fancy stuff).
  4) calculate DFT (to get read of noise from movement in frame).
  5) make files with samples.
