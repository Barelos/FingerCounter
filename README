Abstract:
  A program that when presented with an image of a hand holding fingers up
  tells how many fingers are held up.
  We will try to use NN and CNN.

Goals:
  1) Read images, calculate derivative make samples. | DONE :-)
  2) Train basic neural net.
  3) Train CNN                                       |

TODO: read image
  1) read from camera.
  2) threshold into 2 colors.
  3) calculate derivative (simple no fancy stuff).
  4) calculate DFT (to get read of noise from movement in frame).
  5) make framework to create data set.
